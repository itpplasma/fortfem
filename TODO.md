# FortFEM: Real Curl-Curl Implementation Plan

## Current Status: FAKE IMPLEMENTATION ALERT!

The current "curl-curl" test is completely fake:
- Uses scalar DOFs instead of edge elements
- Assembly is just a tridiagonal matrix, not curl-curl operator

## Current Blockers

1. ~~**No edge connectivity in mesh**: Need to build edge-to-triangle maps~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. ~~**No Nédélec elements**: Need proper RT0 basis functions~~ ✅ COMPLETED  
3. ~~**No curl operator**: Need actual curl computation~~ ✅ COMPLETED
4. ~~**No H(curl) space**: Need proper vector function space~~ ✅ COMPLETED
5. ~~**No Piola mapping**: Need reference-to-physical transformation~~ ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Strategy

**Follow TDD strictly**: Write failing test → minimal implementation → refactor

**Start with simplest case**: Single triangle, then extend to multiple elements

**Verify each component**: Test edge connectivity, basis functions, curl operator separately

**Use reference implementations**: Compare with FEniCS/deal.II curl-curl examples

**Focus on correctness first**: Performance optimization comes after correctness

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Edge mesh infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- **Week 2**: Curl operator implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Week 3**: H(curl) function space ✅ COMPLETED
- **Week 4**: Complete system assembly
- **Week 5**: Error computation and convergence
- **Week 6**: Integration and cleanup

**No shortcuts, no placeholders, no fake implementations.**
